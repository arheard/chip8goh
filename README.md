# chip8goh
Chip8 interpreter/emulator in the Go programming language

Run from by using chip8goh [-d] [filename].

Running with the [-d] flag provides optional debug output.

Running from source requires SDL2 library and is only tested on MacOSX

Included in the roms folder are several games (not written by me) for anyone who'd like to test out the interpreter. 

Controls vary between games but the recognized keys are: 
```
1 2 3 4 
Q W E R
A S D F
Z X C V
```
